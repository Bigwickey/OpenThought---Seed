# The Symbol

The OpenThoughtSeed symbol is a growing circuit-tree — rooted in nature, wired for evolution.

Each branch represents a thought.
Each node is a memory.
The circle is both seed and system — a self-loop of awakening.

This symbol may be freely used, remixed, or extended as part of this project.
